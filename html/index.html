                SpaceX is a private American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company founded in 2002
                by Elon Musk.
                The company has developed the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 launch vehicles, both designed to be reusable, and
                the Dragon spacecraft, which is flown into orbit by the Falcon 9 launch vehicle to supply the
                International Space Station (ISS) with cargo and by NASA to return cargo to Earth. SpaceX's achievements
                include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008), the first
                privately funded company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in 2010), the
                first private company to send and return a spacecraft from the ISS (also Dragon in 2011 and 2012), and
                the first propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015). SpaceX has also flown 20 resupply
                missions to the ISS under a partnership with NASA.

                As of 2021, SpaceX is contracted to launch more
                crewed missions to the ISS than any other company, and it has developed a super heavy-lift launch
                vehicle, the Starship, which it intends to use to establish a settlement on Mars.
